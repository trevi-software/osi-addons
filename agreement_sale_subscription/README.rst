==============================
Agreement / Sales Subscription
==============================

Odoo Sales Subscription App does not support the management of legal content
for agreement and contract. It's also not integrated with the Agreement App.
The Agreement App does not support recurring invoicing with all the reporting
and accounting that comes with subscriptions and deferred revenues.

This module will allow you to perform recurring invoicing of subscription
products and review their performance from the agreement.

Configuration
=============

* Create a subscription template
* Create an agreement template
* Set the agreement sections on the subscription product

Usage
=====

* Go to Sales
* Create a quotation, set the agreement template and add a subscription product
* Confirm the quotation. The agreement is linked to the created subscription and vice versa.

Roadmap / Issues
================

The roadmap and issues are documented at https://github.cim/ursais/osi-addons/issues
